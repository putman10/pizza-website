# Pizza Place Project

#### Epicodus Intro to Programming: Independent Project 4, June 15th 2018

#### By Ryan Putman

## Create a website for a pizza company where a user can choose one or more individual toppings (cheese, pepperoni, artichoke, anchovy, etc) and a size to order a pizza and see the final cost.

1. Allow the user to choose toppings and size for the pizza they'd like to order.
1. Create a pizza object constructor with properties for toppings and size.
1. Create a prototype method for the cost of a pizza depending on the selections chosen. Use your own formula for this.
1. Keep it simple to start! You do not need to have a complex formula for determining cost (although you can if you like). The most important part of this code review is using and demonstrating your understanding of constructors and prototypes.

## Specs

1. Collect user info and create receipt and pizza object with name.
  1. Input = Ryan
  1. Output = name:Ryan, toppings:, size

1. Show/Hide and change view to allow the customization of pizza.

1. User selects toppings which will visually show customized pizza components and store information in new pizza object.

1. User will click add to order starting price calculations

1. Website will return total cost of pizza.
